about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am 26 year old living in South Florida. I am most familiar with C# and .Net.
  I do not have a computer science degree, I use online courses and self teaching to learn new skills. I have completed Tim Corey's [C# Master Course](https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/csharp-mastercourse/).

          Tech Support One is a small company that provides technology support and custom software.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          At Tech Support One, I built mostly windows desktop applications using winforms and mssql server for a database.
          I also worked on some web projects as well for tech support one. At tech support one I was one of a small team of developers.
          Each developer was often given his own project and would work directly with the customer to build the software according to their needs.
          I left this job voluntarily when I moved from Pennsylvania to Florida.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
