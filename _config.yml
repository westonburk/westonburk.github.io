          BarberCo is a proof of concept project for my portfolio. BarberCo.Web is the website for fictious "Mike's Barber Shop",
          where customers can book appointments, view hours, and contact info etc.
          BarberCo.Management is a portal for barbers to login and  view upcoming appointments. And BarberCo.Api provides data for both frontend websites.

          Tech Support One is a small company that provides technology support and custom software.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          At Tech Support One, I built mostly windows desktop applications using winforms and mssql server for a database.
          I also worked on some web projects as well for tech support one. At tech support one I was one of a small team of developers.
          Each developer was often given his own project and would work directly with the customer to build the software according to their needs.
          I left this job voluntarily when I moved from Pennsylvania to Florida.
